********************Square Free Number****************

In the theory of numbers, square free numbers have a special place. A square free number is one that is not divisible
by a perfect square (other than 1). Thus 72 is divisible by 36 (a perfect square), and is not a square free number, 
but70 has factors 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35 and 70. As none of these are perfect squares (other than 1), 70 is a squarefree number.


For some algorithms, it is important to find out the square free numbers that divide a number. Note that1 is 
not considered a square free number. In this problem, you are asked to write a program to find the number of 
square free numbers that divide a given number.

Input Format : The only line of the input is a single integer N which is divisible by no prime number larger than 19

Input Constraints : N < 10^9

Output Format : One line containing an integer that gives the number of square-free numbers (not including 1)

Sample Input :

20
Sample Output :

3
